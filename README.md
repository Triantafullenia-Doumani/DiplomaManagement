# DiplomaManagement

The objective of this project is to develop a web application that allows students to browse and apply for various diploma thesis projects offered by professors. Students can easily explore the available projects and express their interest by submitting applications for their preferred choices. Additionally, the application provides a platform for professors to assign thesis projects to students, offer supervision during the project's progress, and assess the final outcomes.


This project has been tested on a local host environment. It has been developed using the [Spring framework](https://spring.io/), a popular choice for building web applications due to its flexibility and extensive features. [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) has been used as the database management system to store and retrieve data efficiently.
